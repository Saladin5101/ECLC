As the copyright holder of the ECLC compiler project, Saladin5101 grants the following additional permissions under Article 7 of GPLv3:
a) Runtime library link exceptions:
	This means that, despite the provisions of Section 5 of GPLv3, permission is hereby granted to link the ECLC runtime library (including but not limited to libeclcrt, startup files, standard library implementations, etc.) with any software, regardless of whether that software is licensed under the GPL.
b) Exceptions to compiled products
	Code generated by the ECLC compiler retains its original license status. The ECLC GPLv3 license does not affect the license status of user code through the compilation process.

d) Scope and limitations
	This exception applies only to:
		1. Linking and using the ECLC runtime library
		2. Toolchain integration during the compilation process
		3. Generated binaries and library files
	This exception does not apply to:
		1. Modification and distribution of the E-comOS C/C++ Language Compiler itself
		2. ECLC source code (except for the runtime library part)
e) Legal effect
	This exception is granted pursuant to Section 7 of the GPLv3 and is a supplement to the license. If any part of this exception is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the GPLv3.
